This is supposed to be a space MUD. We'll see how that goes.

Started out by copying a TCP echo Server/Client pair into the project. I hope something like this is going to form the communication back bone of the MUD style thing.

Things to do:

1) Get the server as a runnable object
2) Get the server printing out all the commands it received
3) Apply some sort of validation to the commands (say.... do_THE_THING should work but THE_THING shouldn't)
4) Implement requests in the server
5) Modify the client code so that you can send commands over a command line interface
6) Make the commands do something
7) ???
8) profit!
