Things done:

(0)Remove old client/server code - DONE - wysiwyg 
(1) Get the server as a runnable object - DONE - using new style server has enabled this 
(2) Get the server printing out all the commands it received - DONE - see above 
(6) Modify the client code so that you can send commands over a command line interface - OBSELETE -no changes in client neccesary, new server allows this


Things to do:

(3) Implement one to one, one to many and one to all (but not self) messaging in server 
(4) Apply some sort of validation to the commands (say.... do_THE_THING should work but THE_THING shouldn't) 
  (4.1) Sort out responsibilities. There server shoudln't be concerned with anything except passing messages back and forth. Write some
        sort of filter module to handle specific routing
  
(5) Implement requests in the server - I'm not entirely sure what I meant by 'requests' but I', going to sharpen this to - allow a user to print their command stack

(7) Make the commands do something 
(8) Flesh out the player object. Features I'd like:
    (8.1) Some sort of physical interface (alter impulse, check place in xyz, etc)
    (8.2) Groundwork for sprite setting (tbh as this is text base I'll settle for a generic description object)
(9) Flesh out the server (not communications server) bit
    (9.1) have an idea of 'where' players are in xyz
    (9.2) have an idea of time and a 'game_clock' linked into an update system
    
(10) ???
(11) Profit
